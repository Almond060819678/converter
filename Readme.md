Hi!

This is a written on "pure" python USD -> RUB converter.
Thanks to api.exchangeratesapi.io for USD/RUB rate exchange.

Converter is ready to go, to launch it write:

`python server.py`

To test everything goes as expected:

`python test.py`

The best is to use it via docker. Simply pull image:

`docker pull diamondalmond/converter`

and run as container.
